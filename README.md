# Graphql Express Server

-I created a graphql-express server that runs on "http://localhost:7700". The server uses bodyParser and connects with the Graphql schema. In addition, I used a package called json-server that allows the frontend to make calls and add data to the db.json file in this repository. 

# Directions to Use

1) clone repo from terminal
2) change directories into repo, and run “npm install”
3) then, run “npm run dev” to start the node server
4) open a new tab in terminal, and run “npm run json:server” to start up the mock database
5) LEAVE RUNNING while you use react-native, making sure to open new tabs in terminal when you need it
